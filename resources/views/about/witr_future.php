			<p>As a member of the Rochester Institute of Technology and the Greater Rochester Area, WITR 89.7 has always strived to be a vital part of the community. We are always trying to find bigger and better ways to aid our neighbors and get our music out there on the airwaves.</p>
			<p>In order to expand our reach and give as many listeners as possible a view into the WITR experience, we have began our work on a project, codename Studio X. Studio X is our vision to bringing the presence of WITR 89.7 out to as many people as possible. By securing a new studio location, we plan to give our listeners greater insight into our station.</p>
