	    	<p>WITR 89.7 is an indie station at heart. That's why we play indie music!
Whether it be the latest chart topping, critically acclaimed album by a
world famous band or a just-released LP written by guys hanging out in 
the South Wedge, good music is just good music, and we try to get
that to our listeners. Electro-pop, post-punk, garage rock, folk, and
everything else in the indie spectrum can be heard during The Pulse of
Music. All of our songs are picked by DJs who love music just as much
as you do to ensure we're playing what you like.</p>

<p>Now you may have noticed that during the nighttime we take a break from the
indie music. As great as it is, all music lovers know one genre isn't
the end-all of all genres. We pride ourselves in our wide array of
specialty shows, some playing 30+ year old gems such as Reggae Sounds and Bad
Dog Blues, and others featuring new and emerging genres, we'll always
have something that suites your taste. Third wave ska? Check. House?
Check. Heavy Metal? Done. Jam bands? Of course.</p>

<p>So if you ever hear a DJ and like what they're doing, give us a call
and let them know. It'll make their day.</p>
